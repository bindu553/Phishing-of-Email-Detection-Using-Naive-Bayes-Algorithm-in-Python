# Phishing-of-Email-Detection-Using-Naive-Bayes-Algorithm-in-Python
This project validates that Naïve Bayes-based phishing detection is a reliable, lightweight, and scalable approach

The process begins with input collection, where the system accepts an email’s textual content from the user. This data serves as the primary input for analysis. Once the input is provided, preprocessing is performed to clean and standardize the data. This includes converting the entire email text into lowercase to maintain consistency, removing unnecessary symbols, punctuation, or stop words, and preparing the text for feature extraction. Next, in the feature extraction stage, relevant keywords and patterns are identified from the email content. The Naïve Bayes algorithm relies on the probability of certain words appearing in spam versus legitimate emails. Therefore, words commonly associated with phishing — such as “win,” “free,” “bank,” “click here,” or “verify now” — are considered strong indicators of spam.
During the training phase, the Naïve Bayes model learns from a labeled dataset of spam and genuine emails. It calculates the likelihood of each word belonging to a specific class (spam or genuine) using Bayes’ theorem. Once trained, the model applies this knowledge in the testing phase, where new input emails are analyzed. The algorithm computes probabilities for both spam and genuine categories, selecting the one with the higher probability as the classification result.
Finally, in the decision-making and output phase, the system displays the detection result to the user — either “ Spam or Phishing Email Detected” or “Genuine Email (Safe).”
